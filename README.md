3. The scientific, technical services, and finance sectors have seen the most growth in remote work.

4. Key benefits of remote work include a balanced life and reduced commuting time, while challenges include limited social interaction and weaker work relationships.

5. Older age groups are more likely to work remotely.



Conclusion -

Employees seeking better work-life balance, those concerned about commuting, older individuals, and those working in finance and technology are more likely to prefer remote work. Conversely, employees with multiple family responsibilities, those who value social interaction and work relationships, and those who do not face commuting issues are more inclined to work on-site.
